# Capstone-Spotify-Recommendation-System

The specifications of the project are included in the capstone paper attached titled "Spotify Recommendation System Documentation".

The Jupyter notebook contains data visualization created utilizing the pandas and matplotlib libraries as well as recommendation system that allows the user to input characteristics of the music they would like to hear and get the top recommendations by the model. Slider(User Input) functionality does not work directly in the repo: please see the user installation manual located in the capstone paper to set up the project.
