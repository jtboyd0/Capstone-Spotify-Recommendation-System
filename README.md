# Capstone-Spotify-Recommendation-System

The specifications of the project are included in the capstone paper attached titled "Spotify Recommendation System Documentation".

The Jupyter notebook contains data visualizations created through the use of the pandas and matplotlib libraries. It also contains the recommendation system that takes user input song characteristcs via sliders to output recommended songs. The model finds recommended songs by calculating the cosine similarity of tracks to the users input. Slider(User Input) functionality does not work directly in the repo: please see the user installation manual located in the capstone paper to set up the project.
